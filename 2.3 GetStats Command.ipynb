In particular we want a Game class to hold all the overall logic and we'll also start with a Player class to hold the data for a particular user. We'll go ahead and import the Player class into the Game class so we can use it later. In real life, you would probably store data in some form of database, but in this simple case we'll just store data in memory- this is much simpler but means the data will be wiped each time we restart the program. `self.players = {}` creates a dictionary we'll use as our 'database'."
